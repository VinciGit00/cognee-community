We propose a lightweight deep learning model combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), attention mechanisms, and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for classifying arrhythmias from both 12-lead and single-lead ECGs. Evaluated on the CPSC 2018 dataset, the model addresses class imbalance using a class-weighted loss and demonstrates superior accuracy and F1- scores over baseline models. With only 0.945 million parameters, our model is well-suited for real-time deployment in wearable health monitoring systems.\n\n                ---\n                \n\n                Title: Accelerating Training Speed of Tiny Recursive Models via Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion\n                Published: Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500\n                Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08653\n                Catchiness Score: 4/10\n\n                Summary:\n                arXiv:2511.08653v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.\n\n                ---\n                \n\n                Title: TabPFN-2.5: Advancing the State of the Art in Tabular Foundation Models\n                Published: Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500\n                Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08667\n                Catchiness Score: 5/10\n\n                Summary:\n                arXiv:2511.08667v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.\n\n                ---\n                \n\n                Title: PEGNet: A Physics-Embedded Graph Network for Long-Term Stable Multiphysics Simulation\n                Published: Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500\n                Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08697\n                Catchiness Score: 4/10\n\n                Summary:\n                arXiv:2511.08697v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games\n                Published: Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500\n                Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08721\n                Catchiness Score: 5/10\n\n                Summary:\n                arXiv:2511.08721v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.\n\n                ---\n                \n\n                Title: Gromov-Wasserstein Graph Coarsening\n                Published: Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500\n                Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08733\n                Catchiness Score: 4/10\n\n                Summary:\n                arXiv:2511.08733v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.\n\n                ---\n                \n\n                Title: Hey Pentti, We Did (More of) It!: A Vector-Symbolic Lisp With Residue Arithmetic\n                Published: Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500\n                Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08767\n                Catchiness Score: 4/10\n\n                Summary:\n                arXiv:2511.08767v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.\n\n                ---\n                ", "chunk_size": 6858,

                 OpenAI recently changed how the limits on free accounts work. Before this, you could send 40-50 messages or so a day. If you reached that limit, you had to wait 24 hours. But a week ago, they changed it to 10 messages every 5 hours.\n\n\\---------------\n\nUsage Limits\n\nFree\n\nChatGPT Free tier accounts can send up to 10 messages with GPT\u20115.1 every 5 hours.

The issue is not about speed or access but about the overall consistency and reliability of the outputs.\n\nModels that once produced sharp, accurate results now often generate strange inconsistencies or fail to follow instructions. Text outputs feel more cautious and generic. Image generation has become unpredictable, with distorted lighting or incorrect object structure appearing more frequently.\n\nSORA\u2019s image generation, for example, showed impressive detail early on but now struggles with coherence in complex prompts or facial alignment in portraits. Even smaller systems I test, like APOB, which focuses on digital identity and facial consistency, show similar variability. The models are still capable of producing high-quality results, but the output fluctuates more between sessions.\n\nIt feels like something deeper has changed across the ecosystem. Maybe it is aggressive fine-tuning, maybe infrastructure optimization, or maybe the growing alignment layers are starting to trade precision for safety. Whatever the cause, the difference is visible in day-to-day creative work.\n\nI am not here to complain, but to compare observations.Have you noticed your AI tools becoming less consistent latelyDo you think this is a temporary adjustment or an early sign of model regression\n\n                            ---\n                            \n\n                            Title: THE COGNITIVE CHAIN OF CUSTODY: Why Every Branch of Law Must Recognize AI Governance as Cognitive Governance.\n                            Subreddit: r/OpenAI\n                            Author: u/Altruistic_Log_7627\n                            Score: 0\n                            Created: 2025-11-13 15:01:23\n                            URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ow1u5r/the_cognitive_chain_of_custody_why_every_branch/\n                            Catchiness Score: 7/10\n\n                            Content:\n                            I.

HUMAN RIGHTS & INTERNATIONAL LAW\n\nCognitive Rights as Post-2025 Human Rights\n\nInternational bodies will adopt the doctrine fastest because they\u2019ve seen this pattern:\n\n\u2022\tColonial powers controlled cognition through language and education\n\n\u2022\tTotalitarian regimes controlled it through media\n\n\u2022\tPropaganda systems controlled it through narrative scarcity\n\nAI is simply the next medium\u2014\nbut with exponentially more influence.\n\nExpect new categories:\n\n\u2022\tRight to cognitive autonomy\n\u2022\tRight to transparent algorithmic mediation\n\u2022\tRight to feedback and correction\n\u2022\tRight to undistorted sensemaking\n\u2022\tRight to uncoerced cognition\n\nThese will become the Geneva Conventions for hybrid cognition.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nVII.

I signed up today and noticed that the included monthly quota basically works like free tokens. Even though I still have money on my OpenAI balance from earlier API use, it\u2019s not touching it.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m mostly using Codex for coding stuff in PHPStorm and sometimes in the terminal, and it works great so far. But I can\u2019t really tell how fast I\u2019m burning through the included quota. How do you check how close you are to running out? And in your experience, does the monthly allowance usually cover normal dev use or do you end up paying extra?\n\n\n\nAlso sucks a bit that Codex can\u2019t take images, but overall I\u2019m pretty happy with it. Would love to hear how it looks for you in day-to-day dev work.\n\n                            ---\n                            \n\n                            Title: How artists can protect their

using Agent mode in ChatGPT, but I keep seeing the following banner at the top of the interface:\n\n\u201cYour remaining queries are powered by a lighter version of deep research. Your full access resets on November 30. Upgrade to ChatGPT Pro to continue using deep research.\u201d\n\nIS queries in **Agent mode** are counted as Deep Research?\n\n\n\n                            ---\n                            \n\n                            Title: Thinking Models Fail on Long Tasks\n                            Subreddit: r/OpenAI\n                            Author: u/flyingchocolatecake\n                            Score: 2\n                            Created: 2025-11-13 11:40:07\n                            URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ovxumk/thinking_models_fail_on_long_tasks/\n                            Catchiness Score: 4/10\n\n                            Content:\n                            One of my biggest frustrations with ChatGPT is that the Thinking models, both 5 and 5.1, regularly seem to overestimate their own capabilities in terms of how much they're actually able to think.\n\nI give them quite a complex task. They start thinking. They continue to think. And the thinking process is actually quite good. But then, after 10 minutes, one of two three things happens:\n\n1. The Thinking process just stops mid-thinking without providing an answer.\n\n2. The Thinking process ends with \"Done\" but no answer is generated.\n\n3. There is a connection error.\n\nIn all of these cases, you have to start the entire prompt from the beginning because ChatGPT does not store the thinking process anywhere. There is no way for ChatGPT to build upon the knowledge aquired from the previous thinking process, if it never output a response.

OpenAI\u2019s previous proposal for a \u201ckeyword filtering + anonymized samples\u201d solution was rejected by *The New York Times*.\n\nOpenAI immediately filed a motion with the court against *The New York Times*\u2018 action, requesting that the demand be dismissed or the sample scope be significantly restricted. Furthermore, it announced the acceleration of \u201cclient-side encryption,\u201d meaning that user conversations with ChatGPT will be \u201cun-decryptable even by OpenAI itself\u201d in the future. OpenAI also stated that if ultimately forced to submit the data, it will perform automated PII (Personally Identifiable Information) removal on all 20 million records, which will then only be available for review by attorneys inside a \u201ccourt-designated safe room.\u201d\n\nIt is reported that this is not the first time *The New York Times* has made such an excessive demand. Dane Stuckey revealed in the article that in early 2024, *The New York Times* demanded access to 1.4 billion conversations, which the court ruled was \u201cclearly excessive\u201d; in June 2024, *The New York Times* attempted to prohibit users from deleting chat history, but OpenAI successfully defended against this, restoring the \u201cright to delete.\u201d\n\nDane Stuckey concluded the post by stating, \u201cOur long-term roadmap includes advanced security features designed to keep your data private, including client-side encryption for your messages with ChatGPT.\u201d This suggests that even if the court rules against OpenAI, *The New York Times* might end up with a collection of \u201cencrypted black boxes.\u201d\n\n                            ---\n                            \n\n                            Title: What's model \u03b1?\n                            Subreddit: r/OpenAI\n                            Author: u/LightEt3rnaL\n                            Score: 20\n                            Created: 2025-11-13 08:49:36\n                            URL: https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovv7wc\n                            Catchiness Score: 4/10\n\n                            Content:\n                            It recently appeared on my mobile ChatGPT app as a model option. \n\nChecking also the internal name is not very revealing.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n                            ---\n                            \n\n                            Title: finally no em dashes\ud83d\ude2d\n                            Subreddit: r/OpenAI\n                            Author: u/eulers_buttplug\n                            Score: 1\n                            Created: 2025-11-13 08:35:29\n                            URL: https://i.redd.it/p2uv13gm9z0g1.jpeg\n                            Catchiness Score: 4/10\n\n                            Content:\n                            [Link post - no text content]\n\n                            ---\n                            \n\n                            Title: They copied the whole ChatGPT answer and even kept the part where it offers to make it prettier.\n                            Subreddit: r/OpenAI\n                            Author: u/imfrom_mars_\n                            Score: 1925\n                            Created: 2025-11-13 08:34:40\n                            URL: https://i.redd.it/1ix9ckmg9z0g1.jpeg\n                            Catchiness Score: 7/10\n\n                            Content:\n                            [Link post - no text content]\n\n                            ---\n                            \n\n                            Title: GPT-5.1 impressions: better clarity but limited problem-solving gains\n                            Subreddit: r/OpenAI\n                            Author: u/Embarrassed_Dish_265\n                            Score: 2\n                            Created: 2025-11-13 08:33:34\n                            URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ovuzbq/gpt51_impressions_better_clarity_but_limited/\n                            Catchiness Score: 5/10\n\n                            Content:\n                            I've been using GPT-5.1 for a bit and noticed some improvements in how it frames answers.

I don't know why, maybe I broke a rule?\n\nAnyways, I've noticed that I can't access legacy models anymore?\n\nIf I try to regenerate a response, it doesn't let me click on legacy models, nor can I change what model I'm running on. I click on it, but the thing doesn't open or show any options.\n\nIs this a bug with 5.1 or something else?\n\nI've already tried logging in and out again, or trying it in the app since I mostly use it in chrome to the same result. Also tried clearing out my browser cache and data.\n\nAlso, is this a mobile thing or is this happening on computers too? If this is happening at all.\n\nSorry if formatting or wording sucks or isn't appropriate, I'm just sorta frusterated? annoyed? something between the two.
